# Chat History Converter ðŸš€

A simple and interactive tool for converting chat histories between oobabooga TGW UI's .json format and sillytavern's .jsonl format.

## Overview
This interactive Colab notebook serves as a versatile tool for converting chat histories between oobabooga and sillytavern formats. 

Initially I wrote the simple python script which can convert my lengthy and horny oobabooga chat histories in sillytavern's .jsonl supported format, because I could not find any tool which can do that. after finding out that sillytavern produces even more horny responses I decided to write another script which can do the reverse conversion.  

Both scrpits are now present in the Colab notebook so you can try using them by clicking on the button down below

## Important Note

As per my knowledge, oobabooga's TGW UI does not support group chat. Please avoid attempting to convert the chat history of your SillyTavern AI's group chat.

## Customize and Contribute

Feel free to modify the code structure of this notebook to suit your specific needs. I would really love it if someone can make this code adaptable as an extension of the Oobabooga's text-gen-webui
